# VECS
Vivarium environmental control system

To Do (no particular order):

send todo list and overrides to Arduino
  Arduino run todo list in absense of special instructions from Pi
Event handler: Update "should be" relay state based on ToDo list and overrides, verify with Arduino
More debugging logs
manual connect/disconnect serial in debugging screen
Improve ToDo window:
  you are here
  highlight unpaired entries
Arduino shiftout
save on exit
save sensor data hourly
manual control
build seperate graphng utility for analyzing saved sensor logs
